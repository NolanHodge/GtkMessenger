Facebook no longer permits XMPP protocol application for Messenger on Pidgin or Empathy.
The easy solution was a desktop app that displays the messenger.com interface.

Super simple dynamic WebView that wraps Facebook Messenger into a GtkWindow.


TO RUN APPLICATION:
        
	chmod +x INSTALL
	sudo /bin/sh INSTALL 
	
Desktop Launcher will be created!
