COMP 3005 DATABASE APPLICATION

	This repo is entirely free to anyone learning GTK#, Mono, or even SQLite.
	The application was created for COMP3005 Database class at Carleton University.
	
	The goal of this application is to demonstrate the usage of SQLite within a desktop application.


TO RUN APPLICATION:

   Here are the instructions to run the 3005DatabaseApplication GUI

   1. Open a linux environment with sudo access
		you can use a VM or a full on linux/unix based computer
   
   2. Open a terminal.

   3. Run these commands:

	sudo apt-get install mono-devel

	sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp3

   4. Once both libraries are installed then, via the terminal, open the 'Release' folder included with the code.
      type the command 'mono 3005DatabaseApplication.exe' and the GUI will open.

      Example:
      > cd 3005DatabaseApplication/bin/Release
      > mono 3005DatabaseApplication.exe



   Information:
              mono-devel                      - Mono development tools   (http://www.mono-project.com/)                       
              gtk-sharp3                      - GTK# 3.0 suite, CLI bindings for GTK+ (http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/)
      
I hope I made this as easy as possible!
I can also demo the application if you are unable to run it.

Thanks!
