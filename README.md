Facebook no longer permits XMPP protocol application for Messenger on Pidgin or Empathy.
The easy solution was a desktop app that displays the messenger.com interface.

Super simple dynamic WebView that wraps Facebook Messenger into a GtkWindow.


TO RUN APPLICATION:

   1. Open a linux environment with sudo access
		you can use a VM or a full on linux/unix based computer
   
   2. Open a terminal.

   3. Run these commands:

	sudo apt-get install mono-devel

	sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp3

   4. Once both libraries are installed then, via the terminal, open the 'Debug' folder included with the code.
      type the command './Messenger.exe' and the GUI will open.

      Example:
      > cd Messenger/Messenger/bin/Debug
      > ./3005DatabaseApplication.exe



   Information:
              mono-devel                      - Mono development tools   (http://www.mono-project.com/)                       
              gtk-sharp3                      - GTK# 3.0 suite, CLI bindings for GTK+ (http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/)
      
I hope I made this as easy as possible!
